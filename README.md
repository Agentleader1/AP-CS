# AP-CS-A
Since so many of you wanted to use my AP-CS solutions, here's my temporary repo. Read below for more info.

I didn't know there were so many people interested in my AP-CS GitHub repo! Haha. This repo has all my work I've done for AP-CS, and more fun little projects!

Anyways, I've received a lot of emails in regards to people wanting to take my code and use it towards their assignments for school. Although it's a good learning resource, I encourage people to try coding on their own. But I am more than happy to let anyone preview my code as necessary if they find they are struggling. Please shoot me an email and I will try to help out!

About Me: I'm just a self-taught programmer since I was in 7th grade. Ever since, programming came easily to me, as a natural. However, it wasn't really a passion of mine. So I've become a pilot now.
